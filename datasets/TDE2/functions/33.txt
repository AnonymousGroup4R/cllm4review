    "Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try.\n\Yikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best \"average\", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars.\n\I had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3\" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same!! I had deep fried batter for lunch!!",
