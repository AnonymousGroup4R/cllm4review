Here is the refactored code snippet in the form of a function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def convert_mm_to_inch(seq_a):
    # Convert the sequence into a pandas Series
    s = pd.Series(seq_a)

    # Remove the ' mm' part and convert the string numbers to integers
    s = s.str.replace(' mm', '').astype(int)

    # Convert millimeters to inches (1 mm = 0.0393701 inches)
    s = s * 0.0393701

    # Format the values back to strings with ' inch'
    seq_b = s.apply(lambda x: f'{x:.5f} inch').tolist()

    return seq_b

# The given sequence of strings with 'mm' units
seq_a = ['15 mm', '39 mm', '130 mm', '4 mm', '41 mm']

# Call the function and pass the input list
result = convert_mm_to_inch(seq_a)

# Show the result
print(result)
```

The code has been refactored into a function called `convert_mm_to_inch` that accepts a list as input `seq_a`. The list is transformed from millimeters to inches and returned as the transformed output. The function is then called with the provided list using `convert_mm_to_inch(seq_a)`.
