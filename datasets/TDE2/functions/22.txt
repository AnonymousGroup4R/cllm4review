Here's the refactored code snippet as a function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def clean_text(seq_a):
    # Convert list to pandas Series
    series_a = pd.Series(seq_a)

    # Remove punctuation at the start and end, customize based on needs
    # This regex pattern targets: quotation marks, any dashes, dots, or exclamation,
    series_b = series_a.str.replace(r'[-.!?,"]+', '', regex=True)

    # Strip any remaining leading and trailing whitespace (there shouldn't be any, but just in case)
    series_b = series_b.str.strip()
    
    return series_b.tolist()

# Original sequence
seq_a = ['"Do you like this site?",', '"--cool--",', '"...ok!",', '"None",', '"test if this works"?']

cleaned_seq_b = clean_text(seq_a)
print(cleaned_seq_b)
``` 

In the refactored code, the transform logic is enclosed within the `clean_text()` function. This function takes `seq_a` as input (a list) and returns the cleaned transformed result list. The appropriate name `clean_text()` reflects the intent of the transformation.
