=====
Common transformations applied on strings include:

	1.	Changing Case:
	•	Converting to uppercase (str.upper())
	•	Converting to lowercase (str.lower())
	•	Capitalizing the first letter (str.capitalize())
	•	Title casing (capitalizing the first letter of each word) (str.title())
	2.	Replacing Substrings:
	•	Replacing characters or substrings (str.replace(old, new))
	•	Stripping leading and trailing whitespace (str.strip(), str.lstrip(), str.rstrip())
	3.	Splitting and Joining:
	•	Splitting a string into a list of substrings (str.split())
	•	Joining a list of strings into a single string (str.join())
	4.	Formatting:
	•	String interpolation (f-string, str.format())
	•	Padding strings (str.ljust(), str.rjust(), str.center())
	5.	Checking and Manipulating Content:
	•	Checking if a string starts or ends with a particular substring (str.startswith(), str.endswith())
	•	Finding substrings (str.find(), str.index())
	•	Checking if all characters are alphabetic (str.isalpha()), numeric (str.isnumeric()), etc.
	6.	Encoding and Decoding:
	•	Encoding strings (str.encode())
	•	Decoding byte strings (bytes.decode())
	7.	Regular Expressions:
	•	Searching for patterns using regular expressions (re module in Python)
	8.	Transforming Layout and Style:
	•	Removing or converting whitespace (str.strip(), str.replace(' ', '-'))
	•	Converting spacing or punctuation (e.g., converting spaces to hyphens or underscores)



There are several common transformations that can be applied to numbers in various contexts. Here are some of the most frequently used transformations:

1. Arithmetic Operations

	•	Addition: Adding two or more numbers.
	•	Subtraction: Subtracting one number from another.
	•	Multiplication: Multiplying two or more numbers.
	•	Division: Dividing one number by another.
	•	Exponentiation: Raising a number to the power of another number.

2. Rounding

	•	Round: Rounding a number to the nearest integer or specified decimal place.
	•	Floor: Rounding a number down to the nearest integer.
	•	Ceil: Rounding a number up to the nearest integer.
	•	Truncate: Removing the decimal part of a number.

3. Absolute Value

	•	Absolute Value: Converting a number to its non-negative value.

4. Logarithmic and Exponential

	•	Logarithm: Applying a logarithmic transformation (e.g., natural logarithm, base-10 logarithm).
	•	Exponential: Applying an exponential transformation (e.g., e^x).

5. Trigonometric Functions

	•	Sine: Applying the sine function to a number.
	•	Cosine: Applying the cosine function to a number.
	•	Tangent: Applying the tangent function to a number.

6. Statistical Transformations

	•	Mean: Calculating the average of a list of numbers.
	•	Median: Finding the middle value of a list of numbers.
	•	Standard Deviation: Measuring the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of numbers.

7. Scaling and Normalization

	•	Min-Max Scaling: Scaling numbers to a specified range (e.g., 0 to 1).
	•	Z-Score Normalization: Normalizing numbers based on their mean and standard deviation.

8. Type Conversion

	•	Integer to Float: Converting an integer to a floating-point number.
	•	Float to Integer: Converting a floating-point number to an integer.

9. Modulo Operation

	•	Modulo: Finding the remainder of the division of one number by another.

10. Bitwise Operations

	•	AND: Performing a bitwise AND operation.
	•	OR: Performing a bitwise OR operation.
	•	XOR: Performing a bitwise XOR operation.
	•	NOT: Performing a bitwise NOT operation.
	•	Shift: Shifting bits to the left or right.
